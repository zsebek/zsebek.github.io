		<h1>My Biography</h1>

		<h2>Early Childhood</h2>
		<p>To start things off, I was born on May 11th, 1998, to my parents Jeffrey and Marsha Sebek. However, I was not alone.</p>
		<p>A minute after my birth, my twin brother Jason Sebek was born. We were born in Chicago, and have lived on Chicago's </p>
		<p>south side since. My brother Jason and I attended preschool at the Beverly Montessori school, and kindergarten at our neighborhood school, Clissold. </p>
		<p>From Clissold, I transferred to Keller Regional Gifted Center, a selective </p>
		<p>enrollment school in the Chicago Public School system.</p>  

		<h2>Middle School to College</h2>
		<p>After 6th grade, I transferred to Whitney M Young Magnet High School, entering in 7th grade at the school's Academic Center Program.</p>
		<p>I continued my studies here through high school. During this time I joined the school's Cross Country Team, Tennis Team, and other organizations.</p>
		<p>I also began learning Japanese in high school, which led to study abroad experience in Kyoto, Tokyo, and Hiroshima.</p>
		<p>Along with other school activities, I am also an Eagle Scout, like my three other brothers.</p>
		<p>After attending Whitney Young, I enrolled in Tufts University in the Fall of 2016.</p>
		<p>My major is undecided but I have become interested in Economics, Psychology, International Relations, and Computer Science.</p>
		<p>At Tufts I have become involved with TedxTufts, Tufts' Japanese Culture Club, The Tufts Daily, Turbo, and WMFO.</p>
