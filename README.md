1. Currently, I have been able to implement and code
   the content for the home page / index, bio, and resume,
   although I still have to fix some errors. I have been
   able to add these files to the repo several time to check updates and continuously test the progress of my work. 


2. I have not directly collaborated or discussed the 
   assignment with anyone, although I have read the posts on
   piazza to see the discussion of the assignments in the class. 

3. So far, I have spent about 4 hours working on this 
   assignment and familiarizing myself more with git and 
   adding content to my sites.
